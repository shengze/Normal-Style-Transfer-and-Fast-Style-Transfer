# Normal-Style-Transfer-and-Fast-Style-Transfer

Both implementations of algorithms can be ran on PyCharm, Spyder or any other IDEs directly.

To test the implementation of Normal Image Style Transfer, run style1.py file. To set the parameters and image paths, modify the codes in style1.py.

To test the implementation of Fast Image Style Transfer, run stylize_image.py file. Parameters and image paths can be modified in stylized_image.py.

Note that before testing the Normal Image Style Transfer algorithm, VGG16 (527MB) will be downloaded automatically.

## Dependencies:

Python 3.5

Tensorflow 1.0.0 or higher version

OpenCV 3.1.0

VGG-16
